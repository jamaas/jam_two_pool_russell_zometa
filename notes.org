attempting to figure out why lines 45-45 seem to be pointing to wrong elements of I vector?



// Initial state. State values of  QA0, QB0, QT0\\
let y0 = State::new(I[2], I[3], I[4]);

think if should be I 3, 4, 5?

C-u C-c !


going create a new model script, strip out the "total pool" stuff and see if I can graph
the concentrations new name will be "jam_two_pool_no_total"

remember in Rust , vector designations begin at 0 ...

sent text to Sylvain Renevey asking for help, also put a question on Rust users group
asking for suggestions

- need to ask Sylvain why both
  ```// declare the external Rust crates required
  //use ode_solvers::rk4::*;
  use ode_solvers::*;```

  * should be every feature, therefor rk4 line not necessary, covered by others?
