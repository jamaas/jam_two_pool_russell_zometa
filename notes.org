attempting to figure out why lines 45-45 seem to be pointing to wrong elements of I vector?



// Initial state. State values of  QA0, QB0, QT0\\
let y0 = State::new(I[2], I[3], I[4]);

think if should be I 3, 4, 5?

C-u C-c !


going create a new model script, strip out the "total pool" stuff and see if I can graph
the concentrations new name will be "jam_two_pool_no_total"

remember in Rust , vector designations begin at 0 ...

sent text to Sylvain Renevey asking for help, also put a question on Rust users group
asking for suggestions

- need to ask Sylvain why both
  ```// declare the external Rust crates required
  //use ode_solvers::rk4::*;
  use ode_solvers::*;```

  * should be every feature, therefor rk4 line not necessary, covered by others?

Professor Juan Zometa from the International University of Berlin,
answered my question on Rust Users group, and said that he had
encountered the same problem using the ode_solvers crate, inability to
extract non-state variables!  He solved his problem by changing ode
solvers written as part of the Russell consortium called russell_ode.
Then he converted a model he had of a mechanical system to my bio one,
using the russell_ode solver and it appears to work great!  Now to
test it and try it, next to see if I can graph!
